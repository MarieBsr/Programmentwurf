# Programmentwurf

The program is structured into two main modules: developer and developer_group, compiled into a shared library. The developer module handles individual developer details, while the developer_group module manages the groupâ€™s information and logo. The main application uses this library to interact with the user, allowing actions like listing developers or displaying the group logo. The application handles user input and memory management, while the library provides the core functionality.
